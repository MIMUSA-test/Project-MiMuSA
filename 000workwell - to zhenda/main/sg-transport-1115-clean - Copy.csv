So, I booked a cab yesterday evening for today morning, after booking, couldn't find my booking at all, (was not in My Trips) and had to call Comfort Delgro to make sure they got my booking, and they sent a text afterwards. Morning comes, cab with plate YYYY comes, meanwhile, my app shows that the cab that is to pick me up is XXXX, thus confusion between the driver and myself for a short time. After some small talk in the cab, I found out that this issue has been pretty common for his passengers. Some of his passengers booked the cab for example, for 5AM, but on the drivers app, it shows pick up at 6... Other problems being that credit card information and favourite addresses not being integrated from the old app. another bad problem is that they changed the app icon, i think this problem may not be too bad for the younger generation, but for older folks, some could not find the app at all, since after many years comfort delgro used the icon of the multiple cabs, and suddenly changed it completely(this i heard from the driver). worse part is that the driver and his other driver friends have complained to comfort delgro, but no change at all has been put into place. i hope comfort delgro can up their shit, or may gojek be much better for a fight against grab..."
